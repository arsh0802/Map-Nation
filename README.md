## Key Features & Architecture

- **AI Roadmap Generation:**  
  Users receive a custom learning roadmap, generated by GenAI (Google Gemini/OpenAI) and custom logic, based on their goals, available time, and preferred topics. The backend endpoint directly calls the Gemini API utility and saves the generated roadmap to the database for each user.

- **Time-Bound Precision:**  
  The system creates learning plans that fit within the user's specified duration and daily learning time, ensuring realistic and achievable progress.

- **Quiz Generation & Evaluation:**  
  AI-generated quizzes help users test their knowledge, with instant feedback and analytics.

- **Progress & Session Tracking:**  
  All user progress, quiz results, and roadmap completions are tracked for deep insights and motivation.

- **Scalable, Modular Design:**  
  Built with Node.js, Express, React, and Python, the system is ready for high concurrency and easy expansion.

- **Performance Optimized:**  
  Implements load balancing, asynchronous processing, and efficient data pipelines for a fast, responsive user experience.

## System Workflow

1. **User specifies learning goals, topics, duration, and daily study time.**
2. **AI Roadmap Generation:**  
   The backend (Node.js/Express) calls the Gemini API utility to generate a personalized, time-bound learning roadmap, which is saved to the database and returned to the user.
3. **User receives a detailed, step-by-step roadmap** tailored to their needs.
4. **Quiz Generation:**  
   Users can generate quizzes on any topic to test their understanding.
5. **Quiz Evaluation:**  
   The system evaluates answers and provides instant feedback and analytics.
6. **Progress Tracking:**  
   All sessions, quiz results, and roadmap completions are stored in MongoDB for analytics and user motivation.
7. **Scalable Processing:**  
   Heavy AI/model tasks are handled asynchronously, with support for multiple backend workers and load balancing.
8. **(Optional) Model Training:**  
   The system can be extended to train custom models using distributed data pipelines.

## Performance & Scalability

- **Nginx Load Balancing:**  
  The system is designed to run behind an Nginx load balancer, distributing incoming API requests across multiple Node.js and Python workers for high availability and low latency.

- **Horizontal Scalability:**  
  Both the Node.js API and Python AI services can be scaled horizontally (multiple servers/containers). MongoDB supports sharding and replica sets for data reliability.

- **Asynchronous Processing:**  
  All heavy AI/model tasks are handled asynchronously, so the server can process multiple requests in parallel.

- **Optimized Data Pipelines:**  
  Data is streamed and processed in chunks, preventing memory overload and ensuring fast feedback.

- **Caching & Rate Limiting:**  
  Frequently requested roadmaps/quizzes can be cached (e.g., Redis), and rate limiting prevents abuse.

---

## AI/GenAI Integration

- **How it works:**  
  When a user requests a roadmap, the backend sends the request to the Gemini API utility, which generates a personalized, context-aware roadmap. The roadmap is saved to the database and returned to the user in real-time. Quiz generation and evaluation are also powered by GenAI.

- **Why GenAI?**  
  GenAI models (like Gemini and OpenAI) provide ultra-fast, high-quality, and context-rich content generation, making learning plans and quizzes truly personalized.

- **Integration:**  
  The Node.js backend orchestrates all AI calls, combines results, and manages user sessions and analytics.

#### Example: Simple Nginx Load Balancer Setup

1. **Install Nginx** (Linux example):
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install nginx
   ```
2. **Edit Nginx config** (e.g., `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`):
   ```nginx
   http {
       upstream mapnation_backend {
           server 127.0.0.1:3000;
           server 127.0.0.1:3001;
           # Add more backend servers as needed
       }

       server {
           listen 80;
           location / {
               proxy_pass http://mapnation_backend;
               proxy_set_header Host $host;
               proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
           }
       }
   }
   ```
3. **Restart Nginx:**
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart nginx
   ```

## Scaling the System

To ensure MAP-NATION can handle high traffic and many users at once, the system supports horizontal scaling using multiple backend instances and Nginx load balancing.

### 1. Running Multiple Backend Instances

```bash
node server.js --port=3000
node server.js --port=3001
# ...add more as needed
```
Similarly, run multiple Python AI service instances for heavy processing.

### 2. Nginx Load Balancer

Use Nginx as a load balancer. List all backend servers in the `upstream` block. Nginx automatically distributes incoming requests to all available servers.

### 3. Scaling Python AI Services

For AI-heavy tasks, run multiple Python (main.py) instances. Node.js can send requests to any available Python worker, distributing the load.

### 4. (Optional) Docker & Kubernetes

For even easier scaling and deployment, use Docker Compose or Kubernetes. This lets you spin up as many containers as needed, and manage them efficiently.

### 5. Database Scaling

Run MongoDB in replica set or sharded mode for high availability and performance.

### 6. Monitoring & Auto-Scaling

Use tools like PM2, Docker Swarm, or Kubernetes HPA for process management and auto-scaling. For monitoring, Grafana and Prometheus help track system health and performance.

---

## Example: Local Scaling with Nginx

```bash
# Start 2-3 Node.js servers (e.g., on ports 3000, 3001, 3002)
node server.js --port=3000
node server.js --port=3001
node server.js --port=3002
```

```nginx
# Add all server addresses to the Nginx config (nginx.conf)
http {
    upstream mapnation_backend {
        server 127.0.0.1:3000;
        server 127.0.0.1:3001;
        server 127.0.0.1:3002;
    }

    server {
        listen 80;
        location / {
            proxy_pass http://mapnation_backend;
            proxy_set_header Host $host;
            proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        }
    }
}
```

```bash
# Restart Nginx
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

Nginx will distribute all incoming requests across your backend servers automatically.
